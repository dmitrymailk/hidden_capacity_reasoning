       "'Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it\\'s something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\\n\\nSo, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn\\'t seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\\n\\nLet me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it\\'s (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That\\'s 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That\\'s 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\\n\\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I\\'m not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\\n\\nWait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let\\'s see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That\\'s exactly what I did earlier.\\n\\nI guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\\n\\nJust to make sure I\\'m not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it\\'s inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it\\'s inclusive.\\n\\nSo, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let\\'s say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that\\'s consistent with what I did earlier.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I\\'m not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that\\'s exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 76 as the answer. So, I feel confident that 76 is the correct number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\\n\\n1. Recognize that it\\'s an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\\n2. Remember the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1.\\n3. Plug in the numbers: (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76.\\n4. Verify using a smaller example and another method to ensure the formula works.\\n5. Conclude that the answer is 76.\\n\\nI think that\\'s thorough enough. I don\\'t see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods I used to confirm the answer lead to the same result. So, I\\'m pretty sure the number of numbers in the list is 76.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe number of numbers in the list is \\\\boxed{76}.\\n'"

I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",

I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",

So, the formula seems reliable.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus<|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|> a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let's say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That's correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that's exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\n",

But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",

      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5?

Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let<|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|> the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1)<|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|>: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 1<|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|>4, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let's say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That's correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that's exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 76 as the answer. So, I feel confident that 76 is the correct number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to recap, the steps I took were:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Recognize that it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n",
      "2. Remember the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1.\n",
      "3. Plug in the numbers: (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76.\n",
      "4. Verify using a smaller example and another method to ensure the formula works.\n",
      "5. Conclude that the answer is 76.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods I used to confirm the answer lead to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the number of numbers in the list is 76.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100.

      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76.

Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26<|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|> 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",

So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",

In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included.

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",

But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",

Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5?

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",

      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let's say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That's correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",

In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

      "\n",
      "Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that's exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let's say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That's correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that's exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 76 as the answer. So, I feel confident that 76 is the correct number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive.\n",

      "Just to recap, the steps I took were:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Recognize that it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n",
      "2. Remember the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1.\n",
      "3. Plug in the numbers: (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76.\n",
      "4. Verify using a smaller example and another method to ensure the formula works.\n",
      "5. Conclude that the answer is 76.\n",
      "\n",

So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",

Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it's something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it's (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That's correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let's see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That's exactly what I did earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it's inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it's inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let's say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That's correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.
