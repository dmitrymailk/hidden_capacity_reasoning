      "Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. I remember that to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar coordinates, there are some formulas involved. Let me try to recall them.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I think r is calculated using the formula r = sqrt(x² + y²). Yeah, that sounds right. So since the point is (0,3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging these into the formula, r would be sqrt(0² + 3²), which is sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is on the y-axis, three units up from the origin, so it's 3 units away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the angle θ. I remember that θ is found using the arctangent function, specifically θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, since the point is (0,3), x is 0 and y is positive, so we're dealing with the positive y-axis. Hmm, arctan(y/x) would be arctan(3/0). But dividing by zero is undefined. I think I need to handle this case separately because dividing by zero can lead to issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that when x is zero, the point is either on the positive or negative y-axis. Since our y-coordinate is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. So θ should be π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees, because that's where the positive y-axis points. So θ is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me verify that. The formula θ = arctan(y/x) gives us the angle whose tangent is y/x. When x is zero and y is positive, we can't compute arctan(∞) because it's undefined. Instead, we know that the angle is π/2. So yes, θ = π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes when converting between coordinate systems, it's easy to overlook something, especially with points on the axes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0,1) corresponds to θ = π/2. Since our point (0,3) is just 3 units along the same line, it's still at θ = π/2, but r is scaled by 3. So that checks out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the radius r is always positive, which it is here because it's 3. And θ is between 0 and 2π, which it is because π/2 is between 0 and 2π.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there another way to confirm this? Maybe by plotting the point. On the coordinate plane, the point is at (0,3). So it's three units up on the y-axis. In polar coordinates, that's 3 units from the origin at an angle of π/2. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can visualize it as a vector from the origin to the point (0,3). The magnitude is 3, and it points straight up along the y-axis, so the angle is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it is using the definition of polar coordinates. The radius is the distance from the origin, which is 3. The angle is the direction from the positive x-axis to the point. Since the point is on the y-axis, it's directly upwards, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I made any mistakes here. The conversion seems pretty straightforward because the x-coordinate is zero, simplifying the calculation of θ. So I feel confident that the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer**\n",
      "The polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",

       "\"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \\n\\nFirst, I should probably recall the formulas for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates. I think they are:\\n\\nr = √(x² + y²)\\n\\nand\\n\\nθ = arctan(y/x)\\n\\nYeah, that sounds right. So, let me plug in the values from the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) into these equations. \\n\\nStarting with r. Since x is 0 and y is 3, substituting into the formula gives:\\n\\nr = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3\\n\\nOkay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nNow, for θ. The formula is θ = arctan(y/x). Plugging in the values:\\n\\nθ = arctan(3/0)\\n\\nHmm, wait a second. Dividing by zero can be tricky. I remember that when x is 0, the arctan function can sometimes be undefined or result in an angle where the tangent is undefined, which is π/2 or 3π/2.\\n\\nLet me think about this. If x is 0 and y is positive, the point lies on the positive y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that should correspond to an angle of π/2. Because starting from the positive x-axis, if I go straight up along the y-axis, that's 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.\\n\\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with division by zero, I have to be careful. arctan(y/x) when x is 0 can be thought of as the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side. But in this case, x is exactly 0, so I can't approach it; it's just 0. So, arctan(3/0) is arctan(infinity). \\n\\nYes, arctan(infinity) is π/2. So, θ is π/2. That makes sense because the point is directly above the origin on the y-axis.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes people might get confused because when x is zero, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2. But since y is positive here, it's π/2. If y were negative, it would be 3π/2. But since y is 3, which is positive, it's π/2.\\n\\nLet me double-check using another method. I remember that in polar coordinates, the angle θ can be found using the arctangent function, but I also need to consider the quadrant in which the point lies. \\n\\nIn this case, the point is (0, 3), so it's on the positive y-axis. The positive y-axis is at an angle of π/2, which is 90 degrees. So, yes, θ is π/2.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the unit circle. At π/2, the coordinates are (0,1). So, scaling that up by 3 would give (0,3), which is exactly where our point is. Perfect, that confirms it.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the polar coordinates for the point (0, 3) are (3, π/2). \\n\\nWait, let me write that in the required format: (r, θ), where r > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. So, 3 is positive, and π/2 is between 0 and 2π. Perfect.\\n\\nI think that's all. I don't see any mistakes here. Sometimes, when dealing with angles, I might confuse π/2 with 3π/2, but since the point is in the upper half-plane, it's definitely π/2.\\n\\nJust to recap the steps:\\n\\n1. Identify r using the formula r = √(x² + y²).\\n2. Plug in x = 0 and y = 3: r = √(0 + 9) = 3.\\n3. Identify θ using θ = arctan(y/x). Since x = 0, arctan(3/0) is undefined, but considering the quadrant, it's π/2.\\n4. Confirm that the point (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.\\n\\nYep, that all adds up. I think I'm confident with this answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe polar coordinates are \\\\boxed{(3, \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2})}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo convert the rectangular coordinate \\\\((0, 3)\\\\) to polar coordinates, we follow these steps:\\n\\n1.

      "\n",
      "First off, let me recall what f(x) represents. It's a rational function, meaning it's a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. The numerator is 3x - 2, and the denominator is x - 2. So, f(x) is defined for all x except where the denominator is zero, which would be x = 2. That's something to note because if I plug in x = 2, I'll get division by zero, which is undefined.

      "So, f(0) is (-2)/(-2) which is 1. That was easy too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's recap:\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-2) = 2\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-1) = 5/3\n",
      "\n",
      "f(0) = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the sum f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) is 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute that. First, 2 + 1 is 3, so 3 + 5/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add 3 and 5/3, I can convert 3 into thirds. 3 is equal to 9/3. So, 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, hold on, 2 + 1 is 3, which is 9/3, and then adding 5/3 gives 14/3. So, 14/3 is the sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. It's easy to slip up with fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check each function value.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, f(-2):\n",
      "\n",
      "(3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2) = (-6 - 2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. That's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-1):\n",
      "\n",
      "(3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2) = (-3 - 2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct.\n",

      "f(0):\n",
      "\n",
      "(3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, adding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Converting 2 and 1 to thirds: 2 = 6/3, 1 = 3/3. So, 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. That seems right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 14/3 is the sum. But wait, 14/3 is an improper fraction, and the question says to express the answer as a common fraction. 14/3 is already a common fraction, so that should be the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe without computing each function value individually? Hmm, perhaps, but since the number of terms is small, computing each one is straightforward. I think my approach is solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I could consider if there's a pattern or simplification in the function f(x). Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Maybe I can perform polynomial division or factor the numerator in terms of the denominator to see if there's a simplification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try polynomial long division.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide 3x - 2 by x - 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many times does x go into 3x? It goes 3 times. So, 3*(x - 2) is 3x - 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtract that from the numerator: (3x - 2) - (3x - 6) = (3x - 2 - 3x + 6) = 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, f(x) can be written as 3 + 4/(x - 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, that's interesting. So, f(x) = 3 + 4/(x - 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, maybe this can help simplify calculations?\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, since I'm plugging in specific x values, maybe it's not necessary. But it's a useful observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I already have each f(x) computed individually, I think it's unnecessary. Unless I can use this simplified form to compute the sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given f(x) = 3 + 4/(x - 2), then:\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-2) = 3 + 4/(-2 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-4) = 3 - 1 = 2. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-1) = 3 + 4/(-1 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-3) = 3 - 4/3 = 5/3. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "f(0) = 3 + 4/(0 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-2) = 3 - 2 = 1. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, adding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 14/3. Same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, whether I compute each function value directly or use the simplified form, I get the same sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I can be confident that 14/3 is the correct answer.\n",

       "  'model_answer': \"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates... I remember they involve a radius, r, and an angle, θ. The formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar coordinates are r = sqrt(x² + y²) and θ = arctan(y/x). Let me make sure I remember that right. Yeah, I think that's correct.\\n\\nAlright, so the point given is (0, 3). That means x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug these into the formula for r first. So r is sqrt(0² + 3²). That would be sqrt(0 + 9), which is sqrt(9). Okay, sqrt(9) is 3. So r is 3. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nNow, for θ. θ is arctan(y/x). So plugging in the values, that's arctan(3/0). Wait, hold on. Dividing by zero... I remember that's undefined. So arctan(3/0) is arctan(∞). Hmm, arctan of infinity is π/2, right? Because as the angle approaches π/2 from below, the tangent approaches infinity. So θ is π/2. But wait, I should think about the actual quadrant where the point is located.\\n\\nThe point (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis. In rectangular coordinates, the quadrants are as follows: first quadrant (x>0, y>0), second (x<0, y>0), third (x<0, y<0), and fourth (x>0, y<0). So (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis, which is the boundary between quadrants I and II. But in terms of angles, π/2 is the angle for the positive y-axis. So θ is π/2.\\n\\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when x is zero, arctan(y/x) can be tricky. Let me think about the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Similarly, (0, 3) is just a point along the same direction, just stretched out. So yeah, θ should be π/2.\\n\\nBut just to double-check, let me visualize the coordinate system. If x is 0, that's the y-axis. So (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis. So in polar coordinates, that's exactly at angle π/2 from the positive x-axis. So θ is π/2.\\n\\nIs there a chance I could have messed up the quadrant? Well, in this case, since x is 0, it's not in quadrant I or IV, but on the axis. So we can't assign an angle between 0 and 2π that's not on the axis. So π/2 is the angle for this point.\\n\\nWait, let me also recall that sometimes, depending on how you calculate θ, if x is zero, arctan(y/x) is undefined because division by zero happens. So in such cases, we have to figure out the angle based on the position relative to the axes.\\n\\nSince x is 0, and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2. So I think that's correct.\\n\\nLet me recap: r is 3, θ is π/2. So the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). That should be the answer.\\n\\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify. So in rectangular coordinates, the point is (0, 3). Converting back to rectangular from polar should give me (0, 3). Let's test that. The conversion formulas are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ.\\n\\nSo plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2, x = 3 cos(π/2). Cos(π/2) is 0, so x = 0. y = 3 sin(π/2). Sin(π/2) is 1, so y = 3. So yes, converting back gives me (0, 3), which is the original point. So that checks out.\\n\\nHmm, so I think my answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So the polar coordinates for (0, 3) are (3, π/2).\\n\\nWait, just another thought: sometimes, in polar coordinates, r is always positive, which it is here because 3 is positive. So that's good. θ is between 0 and 2π, which it is, π/2 is within that range.\\n\\nSo I think I'm confident that my answer is correct.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe polar coordinates are \\\\boxed{(3, \\\\dfrac{\\\\pi}{2})}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\\\((0, 3)\\\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas \\\\( r = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta = \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right) \\\\).\\n\\n1.

       " 'model_answer': \"Alright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \\n\\nFirst, let me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r equals the square root of (x squared plus y squared). That makes sense because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So in this case, x is 0 and y is 3, so r should be sqrt(0^2 + 3^2). Let me compute that: 0 squared is 0, 3 squared is 9, so 0 + 9 is 9, and the square root of 9 is 3. So r is 3. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nNow, for θ. I remember that θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Since the point is (0, 3), it lies somewhere on the y-axis. Specifically, it's on the positive y-axis because y is positive. So, in terms of the unit circle, the angle for the positive y-axis is π/2 radians because it's 90 degrees from the positive x-axis.\\n\\nWait, but I should double-check that. If I have a point at (0, 3), it's directly above the origin on the y-axis. So, if I imagine a line from the origin to (0, 3), that line is vertical. In polar coordinates, angles are measured from the positive x-axis, going counterclockwise. So, starting at (1, 0), which is 0 radians, going counterclockwise, the angle increases. At π/2 radians, it points straight up along the positive y-axis, which is exactly where (0, 3) is. So, θ should be π/2.\\n\\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me think about the general formula for θ. I believe θ is calculated using the arctangent of y over x, but since x is 0 here, I need to handle that carefully. Because if x is 0, the tangent is undefined, but we can figure out θ based on the quadrant. In this case, x is 0 and y is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. Therefore, θ is π/2.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes people might get confused because in the case where x is 0, like (0, y), if y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, and if y is negative, it's on the negative y-axis. So, in this case, since y is positive, it's the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.\\n\\nAlternatively, if x was negative and y was positive, θ would be in the second quadrant, between π/2 and π. If x was negative and y was negative, θ would be in the third quadrant. But in our case, x is 0 and y is 3, so it's a straightforward case.\\n\\nSo, just to recap: r is 3, and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\\n\\nLet me visualize this to make sure. On the coordinate plane, the origin is (0,0). The point (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis, 3 units long. In polar coordinates, the radius r is the distance from the origin to the point, which is 3. The angle θ is the angle from the positive x-axis to the point, which is π/2 radians or 90 degrees. So, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think about the conversion formulas again: θ = arctan(y/x). But since x is 0, that's undefined. So, in such cases, we have to look at the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the angle is π/2. If x were negative and y positive, it would be in the second quadrant, and θ would be between π/2 and π, but in our case, it's exactly π/2.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, I remember that sometimes, when dealing with angles, we can also add multiples of 2π to get the angle within the desired range, but in this case, since θ is already between 0 and 2π, we don't need to adjust it further.\\n\\nSo, just to double-check the calculations: r = sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(9) = 3. θ = arctan(3/0). But 3/0 is undefined, so we have to consider the quadrant. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2. \\n\\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of the unit circle, the angle corresponding to (0, 1) is π/2. So, scaling it up by 3, it's (3, π/2). That makes sense.\\n\\nWait, but another thought: sometimes, in polar coordinates, θ is measured from the positive x-axis, going counterclockwise, but sometimes people can get confused with clockwise. But in standard math, it's counterclockwise. So, if I were to sketch this, starting from the positive x-axis, going counterclockwise 90 degrees, that should point up to (0, 3). So, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think about the point (0, 3), it's 3 units away from the origin along the y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that's (3, π/2). That's the same as saying it's 3 units at an angle of 90 degrees from the origin.\\n\\nJust to make sure I haven't missed any alternative interpretations, let me consider if θ could be negative. But since θ is typically given in the range [0, 2π), negative angles are usually converted by adding 2π. So, for example, if θ were -π/2, that's equivalent to 3π/2. But in our case, the angle is positive and already within the desired range, so we don't need to adjust it.\\n\\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I feel confident that the polar coordinates for the point (0, 3) are (3, π/2).\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe polar coordinates are \\\\boxed{(3, \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2})}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\\\((0, 3)\\\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates. \\n\\nFirst, we calculate the radius \\\\(r\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nr = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\\\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\\\sqrt{9} = 3\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNext, we determine the angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\).
