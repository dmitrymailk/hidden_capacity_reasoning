       "\"Okay, so I have this magic square problem here, and I need to find the value of \\\\( n \\\\). Let me try to figure this out step by step. \\n\\nFirst, I remember that a magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal. That common sum is called the magic constant. So, my goal is to find \\\\( n \\\\) such that all these sums are equal.\\n\\nLooking at the Asymptote code provided, it seems like the magic square is a 3x3 grid. Let me visualize it based on the labels given:\\n\\n- The top row has three cells: \\\\( n-3 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\), and \\\\( n+1 \\\\).\\n- The middle row has \\\\( n+2 \\\\), \\\\( 2n-9 \\\\), and \\\\( 1 \\\\).\\n- The bottom row has \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\), and \\\\( n-1 \\\\).\\n\\nSo, writing this out, the magic square looks like this:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nn - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\nn + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n2 & n & n - 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAlright, now I need to find \\\\( n \\\\) such that all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum. Let me denote this common sum as \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, let me compute the sum of the first row:\\n\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify that:\\n\\n\\\\( n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the first row is \\\\( 2n + 1 \\\\). That means the magic constant \\\\( S = 2n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nLet me check the second row:\\n\\n\\\\( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\( n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the second row is \\\\( 3n - 6 \\\\). Since this must equal \\\\( S \\\\), we have:\\n\\n\\\\( 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nLet me solve for \\\\( n \\\\):\\n\\nSubtract \\\\( 2n \\\\) from both sides:\\n\\n\\\\( n - 6 = 1 \\\\)\\n\\nAdd 6 to both sides:\\n\\n\\\\( n = 7 \\\\)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me verify this because I might have made a mistake. If \\\\( n = 7 \\\\), let me check the third row:\\n\\n\\\\( 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nBut according to the first row, \\\\( 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15 \\\\). So, that's consistent.\\n\\nLet me check the columns as well to make sure.\\n\\nFirst column:\\n\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nSecond column:\\n\\n\\\\( 3 + (2n - 9) + n \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThird column:\\n\\n\\\\( (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nAll columns add up to 15.\\n\\nNow, let me check the diagonals.\\n\\nMain diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):\\n\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nOther diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):\\n\\n\\\\( (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nPerfect, both diagonals add up to 15.\\n\\nSo, all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when \\\\( n = 7 \\\\). Therefore, the value of \\\\( n \\\\) is 7.\\n\\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me check if all the individual cells are integers and if there are any constraints on \\\\( n \\\\). The problem doesn't specify that \\\\( n \\\\) has to be an integer, but in magic squares, often the numbers are integers. Let me see if \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) makes all the cells integers.\\n\\nLooking at the cells:\\n\\n- \\\\( n - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( 3 \\\\) is already an integer.\\n- \\\\( n + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( n + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( 2n - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( 1 \\\\) is an integer.\\n- \\\\( 2 \\\\) is an integer.\\n- \\\\( n = 7 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( n - 1 = 6 \\\\)\\n\\nAll of these are integers, so that's good. So, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is a valid solution.\\n\\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all the sums check out. So, yeah, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is the answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( n \\\\) is \\\\boxed{7}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find the value of \\\\( n \\\\) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals are equal. The magic square is as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nn - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\nn + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n2 & n & n - 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the first row:\\n\\\\[\\n(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1\\n\\\\]\\nThis sum is the magic constant \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nNext, we calculate the sum of the second row:\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6\\n\\\\]\\nSince this must equal \\\\( S \\\\), we set up the equation:\\n\\\\[\\n3n - 6 = 2n + 1\\n\\\\]\\nSolving for \\\\( n \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nn - 6 = 1 \\\\implies n = 7\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe verify this value by checking the sums of the third row, columns, and diagonals with \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n- First column: \\\\( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n- Second column: \\\\( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 15 \\\\)\\n- Third column: \\\\( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 15 \\\\)\\n- Diagonals: \\\\( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 15 \\\\) and \\\\( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nAll sums are equal to 15, confirming that \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is correct.\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( n \\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{7}\\\\).\""

Let me try to visualize or sketch the grid based on the labels given.\\n\\nThe Asymptote code labels the cells as follows:\\n\\n- The top row (first row) has three cells: \\\\( n-3 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\), and \\\\( n+1 \\\\).\\n- The middle row (second row) has three cells: \\\\( n+2 \\\\), \\\\( 2n-9 \\\\), and \\\\( 1 \\\\).\\n- The bottom row (third row) has three cells: \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\), and \\\\( n-1 \\\\).\\n\\nSo, writing this out, the magic square looks like this:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nn - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\nn + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n2 & n & n - 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAlright, so now I need to find the value of \\\\( n \\\\) such that all the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum. Let's denote this common sum as \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, I can start by writing equations for the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals. Since all these sums must equal \\\\( S \\\\), I can set up equations and solve for \\\\( n \\\\).\\n\\nLet me start with the first row:\\n\\nRow 1: \\\\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify that:\\n\\n\\\\( n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the first row is \\\\( 2n + 1 \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( S = 2n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nNext, let's check the second row:\\n\\nRow 2: \\\\( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\( n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the second row is \\\\( 3n - 6 \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( S = 3n - 6 \\\\).\\n\\nWait, but earlier we had \\\\( S = 2n + 1 \\\\). So, if both expressions equal \\\\( S \\\\), we can set them equal to each other:\\n\\n\\\\( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\\\)\\n\\nLet me solve for \\\\( n \\\\):\\n\\nSubtract \\\\( 2n \\\\) from both sides:\\n\\n\\\\( 1 = n - 6 \\\\)\\n\\nAdd 6 to both sides:\\n\\n\\\\( n = 7 \\\\)\\n\\nHmm, so \\\\( n = 7 \\\\). Let me check if this works for the third row as well to make sure.\\n\\nThird row: \\\\( 2 + n + (n - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the third row is 15. Let's check if this matches our earlier expressions.\\n\\nFrom the first row, \\\\( S = 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15 \\\\). That's correct.\\n\\nFrom the second row, \\\\( S = 3n - 6 = 3*7 - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \\\\). That's also correct.\\n\\nSo, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) seems to satisfy the rows. Let me check the columns as well to make sure.\\n\\nFirst column: \\\\( (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nSecond column: \\\\( 3 + (2n - 9) + n \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nThird column: \\\\( (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nOkay, all columns add up to 15. Now, let's check the main diagonals.\\n\\nMain diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: \\\\( (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nMain diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: \\\\( (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 \\\\)\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nBoth diagonals add up to 15 as well. So, all the rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when \\\\( n = 7 \\\\). \\n\\nJust to be thorough, let me also check the magic constant \\\\( S \\\\) using another row or column. Let's take the first row again:\\n\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 \\\\). If \\\\( n = 7 \\\\), then \\\\( 2*7 + 1 = 15 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSecond row: \\\\( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \\\\). If \\\\( n = 7 \\\\), \\\\( 3*7 - 6 = 15 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nThird row: \\\\( 2 + n + (n - 1) = 15 \\\\). If \\\\( n = 7 \\\\), \\\\( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSo, all the sums are consistent. Therefore, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is the correct value.\\n\\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all the checks confirm that \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) works.

The labels are placed in specific positions, so I can map them to their respective cells. Let me visualize the grid based on the Asymptote code:\\n\\n- The top row (y=0.5) has three cells: \\\\( n-3 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\), and \\\\( n+1 \\\\).\\n- The middle row (y=1.5) has three cells: \\\\( n+2 \\\\), \\\\( 2n-9 \\\\), and \\\\( 1 \\\\).\\n- The bottom row (y=2.5) has three cells: \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\), and \\\\( n-1 \\\\).\\n\\nSo, writing this out, the magic square looks like this:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nn - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\nn + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n2 & n & n - 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAlright, now I need to find \\\\( n \\\\) such that all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum. Let's denote this common sum as \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equations for each row, column, and diagonal.\\n\\n**Row 1 (Top row):**\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify this:\\n\\\\( n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + n) + (-3 + 3 + 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\n**Row 2 (Middle row):**\\n\\\\( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + 2n) + (2 - 9 + 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 3n - 6 = S \\\\)\\n\\n**Row 3 (Bottom row):**\\n\\\\( 2 + n + (n - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( 2 + n + n - 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + n) + (2 - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSo, from the top and bottom rows, I have:\\n1. \\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n2. \\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\nThat's consistent, so no new information there.\\n\\nNow, let's look at the columns.\\n\\n**Column 1 (Left column):**\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + n) + (-3 + 2 + 2) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\nAgain, same as before.\\n\\n**Column 2 (Middle column):**\\n\\\\( 3 + (2n - 9) + n = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( 3 + 2n - 9 + n = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (2n + n) + (3 - 9) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 3n - 6 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSame as the middle row.\\n\\n**Column 3 (Right column):**\\n\\\\( (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + n) + (1 + 1 - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2n + 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\nConsistent again.\\n\\nNow, let's check the diagonals.\\n\\n**Main diagonal (Top-left to Bottom-right):**\\n\\\\( (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + 2n + n) + (-3 - 9 - 1) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 4n - 13 = S \\\\)\\n\\n**Other diagonal (Top-right to Bottom-left):**\\n\\\\( (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\\\( n + 1 + 2n - 9 + 2 = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( (n + 2n) + (1 - 9 + 2) = S \\\\)\\n\\\\( 3n - 6 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSo, from the diagonals, we have:\\n1. \\\\( 4n - 13 = S \\\\)\\n2. \\\\( 3n - 6 = S \\\\)\\n\\nSince both equal \\\\( S \\\\), we can set them equal to each other:\\n\\n\\\\( 4n - 13 = 3n - 6 \\\\)\\n\\nSolving for \\\\( n \\\\):\\n\\nSubtract \\\\( 3n \\\\) from both sides:\\n\\\\( n - 13 = -6 \\\\)\\n\\nAdd 13 to both sides:\\n\\\\( n = 7 \\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me verify this because sometimes when solving equations, especially with multiple variables, it's easy to make a mistake.\\n\\nSo, if \\\\( n = 7 \\\\), let's plug it back into the magic square and check the sums.\\n\\n**Top row:**\\n\\\\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\), \\\\( 7 + 1 = 8 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\n**Middle row:**\\n\\\\( 7 + 2 = 9 \\\\), \\\\( 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5 \\\\), \\\\( 1 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\n**Bottom row:**\\n\\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( 7 \\\\), \\\\( 7 - 1 = 6 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nOkay, that's consistent. Now, let's check the columns.\\n\\n**Left column:**\\n\\\\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\\\), \\\\( 7 + 2 = 9 \\\\), \\\\( 2 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\n**Middle column:**\\n\\\\( 3 \\\\), \\\\( 5 \\\\), \\\\( 7 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\n**Right column:**\\n\\\\( 8 \\\\), \\\\( 1 \\\\), \\\\( 6 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nGood, that's consistent.\\n\\nNow, diagonals.\\n\\n**Main diagonal:**\\n\\\\( 4 \\\\), \\\\( 5 \\\\), \\\\( 6 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\n**Other diagonal:**\\n\\\\( 8 \\\\), \\\\( 5 \\\\), \\\\( 2 \\\\)\\nSum: \\\\( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nPerfect, all sums are 15. So, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is correct.\\n\\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if all the individual cells are correct with \\\\( n = 7 \\\\).\\n\\nTop row: \\\\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\\\), \\\\( 3 \\\\), \\\\( 7 + 1 = 8 \\\\). Yep, 4, 3, 8.\\n\\nMiddle row: \\\\( 7 + 2 = 9 \\\\), \\\\( 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5 \\\\), \\\\( 1 \\\\). So, 9, 5, 1.\\n\\nBottom row: \\\\( 2 \\\\), \\\\( 7 \\\\), \\\\( 7 - 1 = 6 \\\\). So, 2, 7, 6.\\n\\nAll the numbers in the grid are 4, 3, 8, 9, 5, 1, 2, 7, 6. Let me list them:\\n\\n4, 3, 8, 9, 5, 1, 2, 7, 6.\\n\\nWait, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Perfect, all numbers from 1 to 9, which is a classic magic square. So, that's a well-known magic square, and the magic constant is 15. So, that's consistent.\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is indeed the correct answer.\\n\\nI think that's thorough. I considered all the rows, columns, and diagonals, checked the diagonals for the magic constant, and verified that all numbers fit into the magic square.

Let's denote this common sum as \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, I can start by writing equations for the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals. Since all these sums must equal \\\\( S \\\\), I can set up equations and solve for \\\\( n \\\\).\\n\\nLet me start with the first row:\\n\\nRow 1: \\\\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSimplify that:\\n\\n\\\\( n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the sum of the first row is \\\\( 2n + 1 \\\\).

The magic square is as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nn - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\nn + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n2 & n & n - 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the first row:\\n\\\\[\\n(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1\\n\\\\]\\nThis sum is the magic constant \\\\( S \\\\).\\n\\nNext, we calculate the sum of the second row:\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6\\n\\\\]\\nSince this must equal \\\\( S \\\\), we set up the equation:\\n\\\\[\\n3n - 6 = 2n + 1\\n\\\\]\\nSolving for \\\\( n \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nn - 6 = 1 \\\\implies n = 7\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe verify this value by checking the sums of the third row, columns, and diagonals with \\\\( n = 7 \\\\):\\n\\n- First column: \\\\( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n- Second column: \\\\( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 15 \\\\)\\n- Third column: \\\\( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 15 \\\\)\\n- Diagonals: \\\\( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 15 \\\\) and \\\\( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 15 \\\\)\\n\\nAll sums are equal to 15, confirming that \\\\( n = 7 \\\\) is correct.\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( n \\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{7}\\\\).\""
