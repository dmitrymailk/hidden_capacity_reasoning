Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1. Subtract \\\\( O \\\\) from \\\\( A \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Add \\\\( P \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Add \\\\( S \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{8 + 4i}\\\\).\"}"

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

       "\"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1.

Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

       "\"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.

    "# \"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S).

So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that.

Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S).

That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.

       "\"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Problem: If $A=2+i$, $O=-4$, $P=-i$, and $S=2+4i$, find $A-O+P+S$.\\n\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\\n<|vision_start|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|vision_end|> so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly.

So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i<|vision_end|>, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1.

Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1.
