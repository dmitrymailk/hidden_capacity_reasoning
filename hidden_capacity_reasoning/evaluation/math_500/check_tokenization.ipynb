Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1. Subtract \\\\( O \\\\) from \\\\( A \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Add \\\\( P \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Add \\\\( S \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{8 + 4i}\\\\).\"}"

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

       "\"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1.

Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

       "\"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.

    "# \"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S).

So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that.

Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S).

That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.

       "\"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Problem: If $A=2+i$, $O=-4$, $P=-i$, and $S=2+4i$, find $A-O+P+S$.\\n\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\\n<|vision_start|><|fim_pad|><|fim_pad|><|vision_end|> so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly.

    "# '<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Problem: How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \\\\ldots, 99, 100 ?$\\n\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\\n<|vision_start|>Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it\\'s something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\\n\\nSo, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn\\'t seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\\n\\nLet me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it\\'s (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That\\'s 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That\\'s 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\\n\\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I\\'m not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\\n\\nWait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let\\'s see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That\\'s exactly what I did earlier.\\n\\nI guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\\n\\nJust to make sure I\\'m not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it\\'s inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it\\'s inclusive.\\n\\nSo, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let\\'s say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that\\'s consistent with what I did earlier.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I\\'m not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that\\'s exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 76 as the answer. So, I feel confident that 76 is the correct number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\\n\\n1. Recognize that it\\'s an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\\n2. Remember the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1.\\n3. Plug in the numbers: (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76.\\n4. Verify using a smaller example and another method to ensure the formula works.\\n5. Conclude that the answer is 76.\\n\\nI think that\\'s thorough enough. I don\\'t see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods I used to confirm the answer lead to the same result. So, I\\'m pretty sure the number of numbers in the list is 76.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe number of numbers in the list is \\\\boxed{76}.\\n<|vision_end|></think><|vision_start|>\\n\\nTo determine how many numbers are in the list \\\\(25, 26, 27, \\\\ldots, 99, 100\\\\), we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Number of terms} = \\\\left( \\\\text{Last term} - \\\\text{First term} \\\\right) / \\\\text{Common difference} + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nHere, the first term<|vision_end|> is 25, the last term is 100, and the common difference is 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Number of terms} = \\\\left( 100 - 25 \\\\right) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the number of numbers in the list is \\\\(\\\\boxed{76}\\\\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'\n",

       "'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Problem: How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \\\\ldots, 99, 100 ?$\\n\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\\n<|vision_start|>Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number and going up by 1 each time, you can find the total number of terms using a formula. I think it\\'s something like the last term minus the first term plus one. Let me verify that.\\n\\nSo, if I have a sequence like 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the number of terms is n. But in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. So, if I subtract 25 from 100, that gives me 75. But wait, that doesn\\'t seem right because 25 to 100 is a lot more numbers than 75. Maybe I need to add something else.\\n\\nLet me recall the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. I think it\\'s (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus one. Since the common difference here is 1 (because each number is one more than the previous), the formula simplifies to just (last term - first term) + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (100 - 25) + 1. Let me calculate that: 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives me 76. Hmm, so does that mean there are 76 numbers in the list?\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if the formula works. For instance, how many numbers are there from 1 to 5? Using the formula, it would be (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct because there are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Another example: from 10 to 15. That\\'s 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That\\'s 6 numbers. Using the formula: (15 - 10) + 1 = 6. Perfect, that works.\\n\\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem: from 25 to 100. The formula gives (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that should be the number of terms. But just to make sure I\\'m not making a mistake, let me try another approach.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to count how many numbers are there from 1 to 100 and then subtract the numbers from 1 to 24. The number of numbers from 1 to 100 is 100, and from 1 to 24 is 24. So, subtracting those, 100 - 24 = 76. That matches the previous result. So, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can visualize the numbers on a number line. Starting at 25, each step increases by 1 until we reach 100. The distance between 25 and 100 is 75, but since both endpoints are included, we add 1 to include both 25 and 100. So, 75 + 1 = 76. Yep, that makes sense.\\n\\nWait, let me think about another perspective. If I list out the numbers, starting at 25, how many numbers would I have? Let\\'s see: 25 is the first number, 26 is the second, 27 is the third, and so on, until 100. So, each number after 25 adds one more to the count. So, the number of numbers is equal to the difference between 100 and 25, plus one. That\\'s exactly what I did earlier.\\n\\nI guess another way to think about it is using the concept of inclusive counting. When you count from a to b inclusive, the number of terms is b - a + 1. So, in this case, 100 - 25 + 1 = 76. That formula is pretty standard for counting inclusive ranges.\\n\\nJust to make sure I\\'m not missing anything, let me consider if the sequence is inclusive or exclusive. The problem says \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100,\" which uses the ellipsis, indicating that it\\'s inclusive. So, both 25 and 100 are included. If it had been exclusive, like ..., 99, 100, that would be different, but in this case, it\\'s inclusive.\\n\\nSo, if I were to write out the first few numbers: 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100. Each number is one more than the previous, so the count should be 76. Let me try to count a smaller range to see if this works. Let\\'s say from 1 to 5. Using the formula, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. That\\'s correct. From 1 to 3: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression, the number of terms can be found by the formula: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it simplifies to n = (100 - 25) + 1 = 76. So, that\\'s consistent with what I did earlier.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I\\'m not confusing this with something else. Sometimes, when people count numbers, they might think of it as the difference plus one, but I think that\\'s exactly what this formula is doing. So, yeah, 100 - 25 is 75, and adding one gives 76.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 76 as the answer. So, I feel confident that 76 is the correct number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\\n\\n1. Recognize that it\\'s an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\\n2. Remember the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1.\\n3. Plug in the numbers: (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76.\\n4. Verify using a smaller example and another method to ensure the formula works.\\n5. Conclude that the answer is 76.\\n\\nI think that\\'s thorough enough. I don\\'t see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods I used to confirm the answer lead to the same result. So, I\\'m pretty sure the number of numbers in the list is 76.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe number of numbers in the list is \\\\boxed{76}.\\n<|vision_end|></think><|vision_start|>\\n\\nTo determine how many numbers are in the list \\\\(25, 26, 27, \\\\ldots, 99, 100\\\\), we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Number of terms} = \\\\left( \\\\text{Last term} - \\\\text{First term} \\\\right) / \\\\text{Common difference} + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nHere, the first term<|vision_end|> is 25, the last term is 100, and the common difference is 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Number of terms} = \\\\left( 100 - 25 \\\\right) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the number of numbers in the list is \\\\(\\\\boxed{76}\\\\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'"

       "\"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Problem: If $A=2+i$, $O=-4$, $P=-i$, and $S=2+4i$, find $A-O+P+S$.\\n\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of A minus O plus P plus S. The given values are A = 2 + i, O = -4, P = -i, and S = 2 + 4i. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down each term:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nAnd the expression I need to compute is A - O + P + S. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to substitute these values into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by substituting the values:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

Let me make sure I substitute correctly. So, A is 2 + i, O is -4, P is -i, and S is 2 + 4i. So, replacing each term:\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nOkay, that looks right. Now, let me simplify this step by step. I think I should handle the operations one at a time.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle the subtraction of O, which is -(-4). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = (2 + i) + 4\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 2 + 4 + i, which is 6 + i.\\n\\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nWait, let me write that again:\\n\\n= (6 + i) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nNow, let's combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\\n\\nFirst, the real parts: 6, 0 (since there's no real part in -i), and 2.\\n\\nSo, 6 + 0 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nNow, the imaginary parts: i, -i, and 4i.\\n\\nSo, let's add those up:\\n\\ni - i + 4i\\n\\nHmm, i minus i is 0, so that leaves us with 4i.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the real part is 8 and the imaginary part is 4i, so the result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, handle the subtraction:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + i - i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the signs.\\n\\nSo, starting over:\\n\\nA - O + P + S\\n\\n= (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nFirst, compute (2 + i) - (-4):\\n\\nSubtracting a negative is adding, so 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i.\\n\\nThen, add P, which is -i:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + (i - i) = 6 + 0 = 6.\\n\\nThen, add S, which is 2 + 4i:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + 4i = 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by grouping the real and imaginary parts differently.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, A - O + P + S can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nLet me group the real numbers and the imaginary numbers separately.\\n\\nReal parts: 2, 0 (since O is -4, which is real), -0 (since P is -i, which is imaginary), and 2.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A), 0 (from O), -1 (from P), and 4 (from S).\\n\\nSo, real parts: 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because when I grouped them earlier, I had 8 + 4i, but now grouping separately, I get 4 + 4i. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my grouping.\\n\\nWait, let me check again.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, in the expression A - O + P + S, O is a real number, so it's just -(-4) which is +4. So, in the real parts, we have 2 (from A) + 4 (from -O) + 0 (from P) + 2 (from S). So, 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nImaginary parts: 1 (from A) + 0 (from -O) -1 (from P) + 4 (from S). So, 1 -1 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nSo, that gives 8 + 4i, which matches my previous result.\\n\\nWait, so why did I get 4 + 4i when I grouped them? Because I think I miscounted the real parts.\\n\\nWait, let me write it step by step.\\n\\nReal parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 2\\n\\nFrom -O: -(-4) = +4\\n\\nFrom P: 0 (since P is -i, which is purely imaginary)\\n\\nFrom S: 2\\n\\nSo, total real parts: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts:\\n\\nFrom A: 1\\n\\nFrom -O: 0 (since O is real)\\n\\nFrom P: -1\\n\\nFrom S: 4\\n\\nTotal imaginary parts: 1 + 0 -1 + 4 = 4\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i. That's correct.\\n\\nSo, my initial grouping was wrong because I didn't account for all the real parts correctly. So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1.

So, the correct answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = A + (-O) + P + S\\n\\nSo, substituting:\\n\\n= (2 + i) + (4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\nThen, combine like terms:\\n\\nReal parts: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\n\\nImaginary parts: i - i + 4i = 4i\\n\\nSo, 8 + 4i.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\\n\\nA - O + P + S = (A + P) + (-O + S)\\n\\nCompute A + P first:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nP = -i\\n\\nSo, A + P = 2 + i + (-i) = 2 + 0i = 2\\n\\nThen, compute -O + S:\\n\\nO = -4, so -O = 4\\n\\nS = 2 + 4i\\n\\nSo, -O + S = 4 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 4i\\n\\nNow, add A + P and -O + S:\\n\\n2 + (6 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 8 + 4i.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step numerically.\\n\\nCompute A - O:\\n\\nA = 2 + i\\n\\nO = -4\\n\\nSo, A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nThen, add P:\\n\\n6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nThen, add S:\\n\\n6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nYep, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute A - O + P + S step by step:\\n\\nStart with A: 2 + i\\n\\nSubtract O: 2 + i - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n\\nAdd P: 6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n\\nAdd S: 6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n\\nSame result.\\n\\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 8 + 4i.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Substitute each term into the expression.\\n\\n2. Simplify the expression by handling the operations step by step.\\n\\n3. Combine like terms (real and imaginary parts separately).\\n\\n4. Verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nSo, yeah, 8 + 4i is the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\boxed{8 + 4i}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the values \\\\( A = 2 + i \\\\), \\\\( O = -4 \\\\), \\\\( P = -i \\\\), and \\\\( S = 2 + 4i \\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute the given values into the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nA - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (-i) + (2 + 4i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplify each term step by step:\\n\\n1. Subtract \\\\( O \\\\) from \\\\( A \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Add \\\\( P \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + i + (-i) = 6 + 0i = 6\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Add \\\\( S \\\\) to the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 + (2 + 4i) = 8 + 4i\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( A - O + P + S \\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{8 + 4i}\\\\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""
