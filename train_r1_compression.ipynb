I remember seeing sparrow wings, and I think they have two wings. So, maybe sparrow has two wings. But wait, I\\'m not entirely sure. I should check if there are any exceptions or special cases.\\n\\nThen there are other birds like the ostrich. Wait, no, ostrich is a bird, but I think it\\'s actually a mammal. No, wait, no, I\\'m confusing. Ostrich is a type of bird, right? No, wait, no, I think it\\'s a type of bird. Wait, no, I\\'m getting confused. Let me think again.
